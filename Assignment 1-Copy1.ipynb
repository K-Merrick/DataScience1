Four of the columns have quantitative variables (i.e., children, days_employed, dob_years, and total_income). Confusingly, days_employed seems to show negative values for most individuals in the sample; however, I noticed that the individual at index 4, who is retired, has a positive value. I ran a code that shows me the top 30 results for retired individuals and found out that they all have days_employed values that are positive. As such, my assumption is that day_employed is negative for those employed and positive for those not currently employed. I will decide how to deal with this data in the next section.\n"

    "I found that the rows that have days_employed missing line up with the rows that have total_income missing; that is, each row with missing data for days_employed also is missing data for total_income. No other rows have missing data in either column. I printed the DataFrame for those rows missing data and did not find anything that suggests the values are missing because of a relation to anything in the other columns.\n",
    "\n",
    "It turns out that a bit over 10% of our data is missing critical information. Since deleting 10% of the data might skew our results, I don't think it would be a good idea to delete it. (Note: to make the results easier to read, I rounded the number to the nearest 2nd decimal place).\n",
    "\n",
    "Since one of the key parameters we need to look at is total-income, I decided to fill in the missing values for the column. To do this, I first created a pivot table to see how individuals' income differed based on their employment status. I also decided to factor in whether an individual has defaulted on a loan before, as their wages may be garnered and that could reduce their income. The pivot table shows that there is a dramatic difference in mean and median incomes between employment statuses. For example, an entrepreneur makes on average twice as much as someone who is classified as 'business'. There is also a slight difference in mean and median incomes based on whether someone has been in debt, but the difference appears quite small for each employment status. Finally, the percentage difference between the mean and median incomes appears, in more than half the cases, to be larger than 10 percent; since the mean is larger than the median, it means that the data is skewed. This skewing happens because there are a number of individuals in the relevant employment statuses making much more than the median. \n",
    "\n",
    "Given that the mean is higher than the median for most of the incomes of each employment status, I chose to fill in the missing values in the total_income column with the median values of the incomes for the specific area of employment that the individual is categorized in. To do this, I first stored the higher of the median values for each employment status in variables, and then I used a double conditional to set the null values in the total_income columns to the relevant median value. \n",
    "\n",
    "I noticed that there were essentially missing values for dob_years. It did not show up earlier when I was checking for null value counts, but I did notice that some individuals had a 0 value for dob_years. I figured that one's age strongly correlates with their type of employment. To test this, I created a pivot table and took the mean and median ages of all individuals for each employment status. It turns out that the mean and median for each employment status are very close, which means that the data is not significantly skewed by outliers. Based on this finding, I decided to fill all 101 values where dob_years is 0 to the median dob_years that aligns with each individuals employment status.\n",
    "\n",
    "In deciding how to replace missing data for the days_employed column, I first wanted to see which individuals have positive values for the days_employed. I took the value counts of two dataframes, one which shows the counts for those with positive values for days_employed and another for individuals with negative values for days employed. It turns out that only retired individuals and the unemployed have positive values for days_employed, and no individuals in either group has negative values for days employed. This leads me to conclude that those specific individuals are unemployed, and the positive number is a measure of either how long they've been unemployed, or how long the bank believes they will be unemployed for. Given this detail, I chose to set the days_employed values for individuals in each group to 0.\n",
    "\n",
    "In order to fill in the missing data for days_employed, I decided to do it by age. My assumption is that one's age has the greatest factor on how long they've been employed. This may be mistaken and there may be another parameter by which to more accurately estimate how long an individual has been employed; however, given that days_employed is not one parameter we're asked to use when considering how likely it is one will defualt on a loan, I decided to input missing values for days_employed by age simply as an exercise to better my skills as a programmer. That being said, in order to fill in the missing values I first created a list of all ages represented in the data. I then created an empty dictionary and used a for loop to iterate through all ages in the list. In the loop, I calculated the total number of individuals listed with each specific age and found the mean of the days_employed for each age. I then added the information to the dictionary, with age as the key and mean of days_employed for the value. It's important to note that I only considered the rows for individuals of each age that had a negative value for days_employed - this is because I set days_employed to 0 for those who have positive values for the field, as they are most likely not currently employed. By using this conditional, I was able to prevent skewing the data based on those with 0 for days_employed. \n",
    "\n",
    "To fill in the missing values for days employed, I used the .map() method. I originally was going to try using a for loop, but then I found a StackOverflow page that describes the map method. Using this method, I was able to replace all the missing values in days_employed according to the individuals age. The dictionary I created lists each age represented in the data as a key and the corresponding mean days_employed as the value. I then printed the first 30 lines of the data, in which I know there were 3 NaNs, along with the dictionary to ensure that the correct values were input for each individual based on their age.\n",
    "\n",
    "The final count of NaNs show that there is no longer any missing data. \n",
    "\n",
    "--Update--\n",
    "\n",
    "Later in the process I noticed that there were strange values in the children category - a small number of individuals were reported as having -1 children or 20 children. Regarding the former, either it was a mistake in inputting the data or it might represent a family that has a child who is either no longer a dependant. Given that it is such a small number of individuals with -1 listed, I opted to change the values to 0. Regarding those with a value of 20 in the column, I am assuming that this is an error in typeing - may have been caused by using the number pad and accidentally hitting the 0 after typeing 2. Again, this is a small number compared to the overall total, so I don't believe it will make a significant difference; as such, I opted to change the values from 20 to 2. "

    "I started this task by making sure that all qualitiative variables are lowercase. Though certain columns seem to only feature lowercase strings, such as family_status, I called the str.lower() function on it anyways in case there was a hidden string with uppercase letters.\n",
    "\n",
    "Noticing that there were some loan applications listing similar purposes but written differently (e.g., 'car' and 'purchase a car'), I decided to change each value based on its general purpose. To do so, I used regularexpression to change the purpose of anything having to do with purchasing a house/property, purchasing a vehicle, funding a wedding, or obtaining more edication to 'property', 'car', 'wedding', and 'education', respectively. I did this because rows with all columns having the same value, save for the purpose category, would not show up as duplicates. This would be problematic if the purpose was generally for the same thing, as the row would be, in essence, duplicate. By changing all the values to their general form, we are better able to catch duplicates. It might be the case that the same individual opened two applications for loans at different dates and stated a similir purpose for the loan, though not written exactly the same as the first application. By changing the values, such rows would show up as duplicated; however, we would not lose any critical information by deleting the duplicated row, as the critical information for determining a person's likelyhood to default on a loan would still be represented for the individual in the data. \n",
    "\n",
    "It's important to mention that I did not delete all duplicated rows; rather, I made sure to keep the first row for each duplicated set. If I were to delete all rows of a duplicated set, then we would lose critical information about the individual represented in each duplicated set. By keeping the first row, we retain the critical information while ensuring our data is not skewed by duplicates.\n",
    "\n",
    "It is unclear why duplicate data arises in this dataset. It could be that an individual applied for loans on more than one occassion for the same thing, or that the person processing the loan put through an application for each specific phrasing of the purpose. While I do not have much experience with applying for loans, my intuition is that the reason in this case is the former.\n"

To get the numbers that correspond to the box and whiskers, I used the quantile() method to get the values that correspond with each quantile. Using these numbers, I was able to make an informed decision about which range of incomes should apply to each category. \n",

When doing it this way, after assigning Low Income to values in the lowest quantile, the code crashed as it was not able to compare values in the columns using < or > when some of the values are string and some are integer.

    "In this section I first ensured that the data up to this point is correctly reflected. This involved taking the value count of values in the debt column. I then created a pivot table with the number of children as the index and the count/sum of the debt values as columns. The count debt column simply represents the number of individuals with values for the field, which is all of those represented in the data. The sum represents the number of those who have defaulted on a loan. \n",

    "I created a new column on the pivot table that represents the percentage of those who have defaulted on a loan for each category (i.e., number of children).\n",
    "\n",
    "From the data, it appears that there is somewhat of a relation between the number of children a person has and the likelyhood that they would default on a loan. In the dataset, those with no children have defaulted on loans the least, percentage wise, and those with 4 children have defaulted on loans the most. There are, however,two datapoints that do not seem to line up. First concerns the number of those with 3 children; the percentage of those with 3 children who have defaulted on a loan is higher than for those without children, yet lower than those with only 2 children and 1 child. Perhaps this is due to there being far fewer individuals who have 3 children and applied for a loan represented in the dataset. The second questionable datapoint is for those with 5 children. Given the trend, you'd expect individuals with 5 children to have at least some percentage of loan defaults; however, the data shows that, of the applicants with 5 children, none have defaulted on a loan previously. This is highly questionable and likely comes down to the sample size. Individuals with 5 children are severly underrepresented in the data, and that likely skews the results.\n",
    "\n",
    "Overall, I'm hesitant to state that there is a strong relation due to the differences in sample size. Clearly, those with 0 children are represented to a much higher degree than those with 5 children. Because of the small sample sizes for those with 4 and 5 children, and perhaps 3, we cannot dinifitively say that there is an actual correlation. Nonetheless, we can draw a loose hypothesis based on the data we have - that is, the fewer children an individual has, the less likely they are to default on a loan.\n"

To do so without arbitrarily chosing values, I created a box and whisker plot to visualize the distribution of total_income for each applicant. I then obtained the values for important quartiles represented in the data and organized total_income into categories based on the quartiles. This allowed me to distinguish between low, medium, high, and very high income individuals. \n",

    "Overall, the clearest relationship I found between one parameter and likelyhood that an individual will default on a loan is based on the number of children an individual has. Those with no children appear less likely than those with more children to default on a loan. This observation, however, is not without its exceptions - for example, people with 3 children seem to not follow the observed trend. I hypothesize that this is due to the unequal represtation of each group in the data.\n",
    "\n",
    "While I believe that unequal represntation of data affected each analysis carried out, by purely relying on the data we have, someone processing loan applications might interpret the results of each analysis as follows:\n",
    "\n",
    "1) The greater the number of children one has, the more likely they are to default on a loan.\n",
    "\n",
    "2) Regarding family status, those who are unmarried are most likely to default on a loan while those who are widows or widowers are least likely.\n",
    "\n",
    "3) With regard to income bracket, those in the medium bracket are most likely to default on a loan, while those in the very high bracket are least likely. \n",
    "\n",
    "4) Regarding loan purpose, those who apply for a loan to purchase a vechile are most likely to default on a loan, while those who apply for a loan to purchase property are least likely.\n",
    "\n",
    "Given this information, I would argue that those processing loan applications should first look at the number of children an individual has when determining whether it is safe to offer an individual a loan. The most high-risk loans from this data would be to those who have a high number of children, are unmarried, are in the medium income bracket, and wish to use the loan to purchase a vehicle. "
